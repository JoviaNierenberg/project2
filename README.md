# Breadth-first search

Breadth-first search involves traversing each layer before moving onto the next layer (it also makes me think of bread). A queue is used to keep track of nodes to visit, using a first-in first-out approach. The time complexity is O(V+E), where V=vertices and E=edges. It finds the shortest path. 

The assignment instructions have been moved to the instructions directory.
